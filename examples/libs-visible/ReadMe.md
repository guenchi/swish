## Compiler Flags

This example compiles a simple program with and without the `--libs-visible`
flag and compares the results.

### Trying the example

1. Follow the [setup instructions](../ReadMe.md#Setup) to ensure that a
   compatible Swish binary can be found via your PATH.
1. Review the output generated when you run:
   ```
   $ make
   ```
